## SiteBlocker

#### SiteBlocker is a simple Python-based application that helps you block specific websites by modifying your system's hosts file. The project is designed to help you block distracting websites (such as social media) to improve productivity or to enforce time-based restrictions.

## Features:
- Website Blocking: Block specific websites (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, etc.) by redirecting them to 127.0.0.1 (localhost).
- Time-Based Blocking: Configure the script to block websites only during a specific time period (e.g., work hours) or continuously.
- Easy Setup: Modify your system's hosts file without manually editing it.
